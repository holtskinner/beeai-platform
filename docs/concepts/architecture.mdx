BeeAI is designed with a local-first philosophy - you can start immediately by running agents directly on your laptop with full data control. When you're ready to scale, the same platform can be easily deployed as a hosted instance for your team.

## Deployment Options

### Local Development (Default)

Perfect for individual developers and experimentation:
- **Zero setup** - runs entirely on your laptop
- **Full data control** - everything stays local
- **Offline capable** - works without internet after initial setup
- **LLM flexibility** - connect to local providers like Ollama or cloud APIs

### Hosted Team Instance

Scale to team collaboration with the same platform:
- **Centralized deployment** - one instance serves your entire team
- **Shared agent catalog** - developers publish, end users discover
- **Unified management** - control LLM connections, costs, and access
- **Team coordination** - consistent interfaces and shared resources

Both options use the exact same architecture - the only difference is where the BeeAI Server runs.

## Core Components

The platform is built around several core components, illustrated in the diagram below:

### Agents

An **agent** is a lightweight container that communicates using the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev). Agents may also define **tools** to extend their capabilities.

<Info>
    BeeAI comes with several built-in agents. Browse the full list in our [Agent Catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents).

### BeeAI Server

The **BeeAI server** coordinates the platform:
- Manages the lifecycle of agents (spawning and destroying containers)
- Routes communication between agents and clients via the ACP interface
- Handles agent configs and environment variables
- Collects telemetry data and sends it to [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) via OpenTelemetry (OTEL)

The server uses an official [agent registry](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/blob/main/agent-registry.yaml) on GitHub to discover available agents.

### BeeAI CLI and UI

BeeAI offers two main interfaces:
- The CLI, for scripting and command-line control
- The UI, for interacting through a graphical interface (e.g., chat or hands-off mode)

To start interacting with an agent: `beeai run <name>`

Or open the web interface at [localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333).

<Info>
    Check out the
    [beeai-cli](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/tree/main/apps/beeai-cli) and
    [beeai-ui](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/tree/main/apps/beeai-ui) repositories.
</Info>

## Python Client Integration

You can also integrate BeeAI into your Python applications using the [ACP SDK](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp). This makes it easy to coordinate multiple agents programmatically within your own workflows.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Arize Phoenix Integration

BeeAI supports observability through [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/), an open-source tool for tracing agent behavior.

For more details, see our [Observe Agents](/how-to/observe-agents) guide.
